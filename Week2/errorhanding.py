Handling Errors and Exceptions in Python
When writing Python code, errors or unexpected situations may occur. These can be broadly categorized into two types: errors and exceptions. While errors are typically unrecoverable and halt the program, exceptions can be handled gracefully.

Handling Errors:
Errors are issues that occur during the execution of the program and cannot be recovered. One common example is the division by zero error (ZeroDivisionError). When an error occurs, the program terminates, and an error message is displayed.

python
Copy code
# Example of a division by zero error
"""
result = 1 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
"""
Handling Exceptions:
Exceptions, on the other hand, are issues that can be anticipated and handled within the code. This is done using the try and except blocks.

python
Copy code
"""
# Example of handling a division by zero exception
try:
    result = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
    # Handle the exception gracefully here
"""
Conclusion:
While errors and exceptions are treated differently in Python, they can be conceptually similar. Understanding how to handle them effectively is crucial for writing robust and reliable code.
